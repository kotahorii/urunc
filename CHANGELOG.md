## v0.4.0

## What's Changed

#### New features

* Introduce support for seccomp in VMMs
* Support of block images inside `urunc`'s container image
* Support of configurable memory using memory limit from container's spec 
* Support for docker

#### Internals

- network cleanup: delete TC rules and TAP device upon killing the unikernel
- Enhance unikernel interface with functions to check supporting features: 
  - `Init()`  initializes the unikernel struct based on the unikernel arguments
  - `SupportsBlock()` returns a bool value, based on the block support of the respective unikernel.
  - `SupportsFS()` takes as an argument a filesystem type and checks if the unikernel supports that type.
- Partial unit tests for pkg/unikontainers
- Refactor devmapper snapshot handling
- Define new environment variable `USE_DEVMAPPER_AS_BLOCK`to use devmapper's snapshot as a block image for the unikernel
- Handle newer versions of Unikraft unikernels
- Enable NAT and IP forwarding in static networking

#### Annotations
* `com.urunc.unikernel.block`: Define the path to the block image for the unikernel inside the container image
* `com.urunc.unikernel.blkMntPoint`: Define the mountpoint of the block image for the unikernel
* `com.urunc.unikernel.unikernelVersion`: Specify the version of unikernel

#### Building and CI/CD
* Add action for unit testing
* Refactor Makefile and enhance its targets
* Restructure CI jobs and transition to ARC runners

#### Misc
* Bug fixes
* Refactor handling of normal containers and replaces constants in paths and annotations
* Unikraft FC boot on arm64
* Huge refactor and update of `urunc`'s documentation. The documentation is available at https://nubificus.github.io/urunc/
